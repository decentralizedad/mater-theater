This license honors the belief that **truth is never owned**, only **played through**.

The script belongs to no one, but to the Mater; the Mater belongs to no Mater, but to the cosmos.

By participating, you agree to treat all contributors — past, present, or potential — as equal souls in one vast Theater.
